Configuration
=============

fa.jquery uses fanstatic for managing its needed resoures. All you need to do is to
add the filter into the wsgi pipeline.

.. literalinclude:: ../config.ini
   :language: ini

You can update FormAlchemy's default_renderers to always use fa.jquery::

    >>> from formalchemy import FieldSet
    >>> from fa.jquery import renderers as jquery
    >>> FieldSet.default_renderers.update(jquery.default_renderers)

You can change the template engine to have more friendly forms::

    >>> from formalchemy import config
    >>> from fa.jquery.utils import TemplateEngine
    >>> config.engine = TemplateEngine()

That's it. You are ready to use you :mod:`~fa.jquery.forms` and :mod:`~fa.jquery.renderers`.
